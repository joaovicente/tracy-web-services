        This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Rest DSL,
        and using camel-swagger-java to expose the REST service APIs.

        <br/>

        This sample project is based on the example projects provided in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/camel">Camel repository</a></br>
        It differs from the examples in that, it provides a single example that:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Bundles a WAR containing swagger-ui</li>
            <li>Uses the Java Rest DSL</li>
            <li>Is self contained (i.e. does not depend from Camel examples parent pom)</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
        There is a <i>user</i> REST service that supports the following operations
        <ul>
            <li>GET /user/{id} - to view a user with the given id</li>
            <li>GET /user/final - to view all users</li>
            <li>PUT /user - to update/create an user</li>
        </ul>

        The view operations are HTTP GET, and update is using HTTP PUT.

        From a web browser you can access the first two services using the following links

        <ul>
            <li><a href="v1/user/123">user/123</a> - to view the user with id 123</li>
            <li><a href="v1/user/findAll">user/findAll</a> - to list all users</li>
        </ul>

        From the command shell you can use curl to access the service as shown below:
<pre>
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-swagger-svc/v1/user/123
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-swagger-svc/v1/user/findAll
    curl -X PUT -d "{ \"id\": 666, \"name\": \"The devil\"}" -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-swagger-svc/v1/user
</pre>

        Notice when trying to get user with id 789 then there is a built-in delay of 0.5-2 seconds, to simulate some
        slowness in the service.

        <p/>
        This example offers an API browser using Swagger which is accessible from the following link
        <ul>
            <li><a href="v1/api-doc">api-doc</a> - Api Doc</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
        To use the swagger ui, follow this link. Replace the URL value with this one to access the REST local resources http://localhost:8080/camel-swagger-svc/v1/api-doc
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">swagger</a> - swagger ui page</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
